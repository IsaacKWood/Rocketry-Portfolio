# Rocketry-Portfolio – Isaac Wood

I am an undergraduate Mechanical Engineering student with an Electrical Engineering minor, building hands-on engineering projects focused on mechanical design, iteration, and applied physics. This GitHub portfolio highlights independent projects developed outside of coursework and documented in accordance with professional engineering practices.

### Project Overview
Fuzebox is a personally designed and built high-power model rocket developed to strengthen my CAD skills and deepen my understanding of applied rocketry physics. I independently handled the full engineering cycle, including design, iteration, manufacturing, testing, and documentation.

The project consists of two major versions so far (P1 and P2), with design decisions driven by flight experience and basic physics-based analysis. There are plans to make more models in the future to push the limits on the concept of a small rocket with a tumble recovery system.

### Iteration Summary
- **Fuzebox P1**
  - Fully designed and manufactured independently
  - Flown twice successfully
  - Used as a baseline to evaluate structural integrity, stability, and recovery behavior

- **Fuzebox P2**
  - Currently under construction
  - Incorporates design improvements informed by P1 flight data and analysis
  - Changes include:
    - Improved structural strength through print orientation and geometry
    - Adjusted mass distribution for improved stability after launch
    - Refined fin geometry for better aerodynamic performance
    - Design tweaks to improve maximum altitude and controlled tumble recovery

### Engineering Focus
- Conceptual mechanical design supported by basic calculations
- Stability and mass distribution considerations
- Structural reinforcement through manufacturing strategy
- Iterative improvement based on real flight experience
